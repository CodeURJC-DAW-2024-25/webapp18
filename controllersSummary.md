## üìù Review Controller

The `ReviewController` serves as the primary management interface for apartment review-related operations, facilitating review submission, retrieval, and dynamic content loading.

### Principal Methods

| Method | Endpoint | Operational Description |

| **loadMoreReviews** | `GET /loadMoreReviews/{id}/{start}/{end}` | Implements AJAX-based pagination mechanism for incremental review retrieval. |

#### Sophisticated Features:
- Comprehensive statistical analysis including aggregate review count and score distribution
- Advanced infinite scrolling implementation via AJAX methodology
- Rigorous validation protocols ensuring review submission only by verified managers

## üè† Room Controller

The `RoomController` represents a foundational architectural component, currently functioning as a dependency injection mechanism for the `RoomService`. Although currently minimal in implementation, it establishes a robust framework for future room-related operational expansions.
